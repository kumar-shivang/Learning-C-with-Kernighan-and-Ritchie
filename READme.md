# Learning C programming language - Using Classic K&R book

As an aspiring data scientist, Python has always been my primary language. I also learnt some javascript to work with web apps.
But after some time I realized that I need some more low level programming language to understand how things work under the hood. That's why I am going to learn C.

## Resources

1. [Kernighan and Ritchie book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language)
2. [Dr. Chuck C course website](https://www.cc4e.com)
3. [Dr. Chuck freecodecamp video tutorial](https://youtu.be/PaPN51Mm5qQ?si=b1ZSj2p_rxfOb3Ps)

## My goal with C

After learning C, I will try to implement some data structures and algorithms in C, and maybe some CLI project if I feel like it. After that I will learn computer architecture and operating systems to finally learn CUDA and OpenCL programming.
